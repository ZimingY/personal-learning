## In-place algorithm

ransforms input using no __auxiliary data structure__, while a small amount of extra storage space is allowed for __auxiliary variables__.

input is usually __overwritten__ by the output.

the strict definition of in-place algorithms includes all algorithms with __O(1)__ space complexity.
